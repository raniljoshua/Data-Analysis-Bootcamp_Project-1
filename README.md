Title: Affordability of 2023 vehicles by median household income

There are many factors that contribute to the cost of a vehicle, but during and post pandemic, we find that the average cost of a vehicle is affected by the manufacturing supply availability, the United Auto Workers (UAW) Union strike, the lack of inventory, etc. Not only is the cost of a vehicle increasing, but our groceries and gas prices are also rising, with no major change to the minimum wages for American families, which leaves us wondering how families can afford a new vehicle. We will be taking a dive into the 2020 census data and the data for current 2023 vehicle prices and figure out what types of vehicles the median household can afford.
